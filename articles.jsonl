The surge also reflects how well we, as a developer and as a nation, have done in catering to investor\u2019s needs. We are now looking forward to a successful and lucrative future for all of our stakeholders.\u201d\nMirwais Azizi, Founder and Chairman of Azizi Developments, added: \u201cWe are delighted to see the recent increase in the number of buyers for our world-class developments and welcome our dear friends from India and Pakistan with open arms. Dubai's awe-inspiring, stable, and growth-inclined real estate landscape has always been a magnet for people from India and Pakistan, and the recent resumption of flights has given further impetus to this trend. The UAE has now vaccinated more than 75.7 percent of its population - per capita, the country is now the most vaccinated country in the world. The surge in sales reflects the confidence the UAE oozes as a country and the quality of product we offer as a developer.\u201d\nOne of its many projects that these efforts are reflected in is Riviera \u2013 Azizi\u2019s French Mediterranean-inspired residential and commercial community in one of the most sought-after destinations in Dubai \u2013 MBR City. Designed to introduce the French-Mediterranean lifestyle to Dubai, which is not merely about architectural art but also about a certain \u2018joie de vivre\u2019 \u2014 a celebration of life, an exultation of spirit, Riviera represents a new landmark destination.\nRiviera, a stylish waterfront-lifestyle destination, is planned to comprise 71 mid-rise buildings with approximately 16,000 residences upon its completion that are conveniently located in the midst of all the business, leisure and retail hubs of the city. It features three districts: an extensive retail boulevard, the lagoon walk with artisan eateries and boutiques, and Les Jardins \u2014 a vast, lush-green social space. Riviera is also host to the world\u2019s second largest lagoon - its very own 2.7km-long body of clean, desalinated water that residents can swim in.\nWith its strategic location near the upcoming Meydan One Mall and the Meydan Racecourse \u2014 home of the Dubai World Cup \u2014 as well as Dubai\u2019s most noteworthy points of interest, Riviera represents one of Azizi Developments\u2019 most coveted projects.\nAzizi Aliyah is also a popular choice among investors from India and Pakistan, featuring 346 residences comprising 191 studios as well as 135 one- and 20 two-bedroom units, in addition to 16,000 sq. ft of premium retail space. Built on the concept of maximising terrace space through staggered slabs and unroofed balconies, the uniquely designed, 16-storey building overlooks the surrounding Healthcare City area that encompasses the Dubai Creek and a stunning skyline. Situated on Al Khail Road, 15 minutes from Dubai International Airport, and in proximity to all major business, leisure and retail hubs, hospitals, and Wafi Mall, this development delivers on consumer demand for residential buildings in this highly sought-after area. Since its launch, Azizi Aliyah has recorded a strong response from customers for its strategic location and the easy access to upscale amenities and family-oriented activities.\nIndian and Pakistani investors are also purchasing in Al Furjan, now one of the most desirable addresses in the entire Dubai, which is home to contemporary architecture that is carefully blended with natural green spaces and well-though-out, state-of-the-art infrastructure. New amenities, from small convenience stores and educational institutions such as Arbor school within the community, all the way to IKEA in Festival Plaza, have opened. With its excellent network of \u00a0roads, including immediate connectivity to Sheikh Zayed Road and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road, Furjan grants easy access to Dubai\u2019s key points of interest, such as Dubai Marina, Downtown Dubai, Dubai International Airport, Al Maktoum International Airport, and more. Moreover, Al Furjan\u2019s direct connection to Al Asayel Street has recently been opened, granting residents near-instant access to other communities such as the Meadows, Springs and Al Barsha, all the way to Downtown Dubai. Al Furjan\u2019s connectivity is complemented by it now being part of Route 2020, the metro route that links it to the Expo 2020 site and the emirate\u2019s many leisure, business and retail hubs via Dubai Metro\u2019s Red Line.\n"}]}

Painted by renowned Serbian artist Milan Kal, the mural took over two weeks to reach completion. With predominant shades of blue, matching the turquoise waters of the Arabian Sea surrounding the building, and portraying Mina contemplating the beauty of pearls, the painting conveys a unique, modern sense of love, hope and affinity, perfectly reflecting the ambience of the project and complementing its premium, well-thought-out design.\nTo supplement the mural, Azizi also partnered with Preciosa, a renowned supplier from the Czech Republic, to create custom-made crystal chandeliers inspired by traditional Bohemian, artisan craftsmanship and based on progressive illumination innovations, to light up the lobby. Each chandelier comprises tiered crystals shaped as pearl drops, made from hand-blown, triplex opal and light-blue Bohemian crystals.\nIn his remarks, Farhad Azizi, CEO of Azizi Developments, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that this building is extremely dear to me and everyone at Azizi Developments - my love for my daughter echoes through every part and detail of this prestigious project. This is a way of developing that we try to instil in all of our staff \u2013 we don\u2019t just build buildings. We build homes with meaning, with a purpose beyond mere housing \u2013 homes that will truly enrich lifestyles for generations to come.\u201d\nSpanning nearly 38,500 square metres of built-up area, Mina features 178 units, comprising 120 one-bedroom apartments, 54 two-bedroom residences, and four spacious, lavishly designed penthouses, all scheduled to be completed by year\u2019s end. The project also features several retail units spread across 1,847 square metres.Immaculately designed to leverage its waterfront location and overlooking the Arabian Gulf with stunning views of the city\u2019s spectacular skyline, Mina offers residents seaside serenity at its finest, as well as a premium range of exceptional amenities that comprise private beach access, two swimming pools, a fully equipped gym and a comprehensive health club.\nOver 69% of the project\u2019s total area is allocated for lifestyle-enhancing amenities, including vast green gardens, a children\u2019s play area, a jogging track, and green outdoor spaces. Mina residents will also enjoy immediate proximity to the Palm\u2019s extensive promenade, where families can bask in the orange glow of Dubai\u2019s soothing sunsets, and active residents can take advantage of an ideal scenery for early-morning runs.\nHosting a dedicated retail precinct, covered parking spaces and concierge services, Mina also offers easy access to the Palm Monorail, Dubai Tram, and Dubai Metro as well as a variety of hotels and other retail and leisure attractions in its vicinity. The project embodies a truly exclusive, privileged, and resort-like lifestyle that enriches the lives of its residents, and is a manifestation of Azizi Development\u2019s customer-centricity, attention to detail, and contributions to the development of the UAE\u2019s awe-inspiring landscape.\n"}]}
